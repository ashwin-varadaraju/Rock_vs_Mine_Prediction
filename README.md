# Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction

## Problem Statement:

This project is about predicting rocks against mines using SONAR technology with the help of Machine Learning. Submarines use the SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging) technology, which is a technique based on the principle of reflection of ultrasonic sound waves. These sound waves propagate through water and reflect on hitting the ocean bed or any object obstructing its path.

#### Rock - 0
#### Mine - 1
